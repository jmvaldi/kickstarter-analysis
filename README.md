# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to visualize different data sets for Louise regarding how other campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To delve into the analysis, we first filtered the data set on the kickstarter sheet for the subcategory "plays". We then decided to look at the data over a sinlge year period, to do this we extracted the year of each play campaign using the YEAR() function in excel. A pivot table was created to organize and analyze the number of plays that were successful, failed, and canceled. A line graph was then made using the data from the pivot table.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For this module we had to use the COUNTIF() function on excel for the first time. The tutorial video fell short on how to use the new function. Thus I had to find others ways to see how the function is properly used to extract the required information from the Kickstarter. Making the graph from the percentage outcomes for the subcategory theater was a challenge if the COUNTIF() function was used improperly. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There seems to be a lot of success with launch dates around the spring, with a steady decline in the summer time. October seems to be a good month for launch date since there was no recorded cancellation.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looking at the data from this sheet we can say that there is a higher nunber of failed campaigns with lower goals. Ranging in the less than one thousand goal. There seems to be more successful campaigns when the pledged amount is  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Looking at multiple Parent Categories would become difficult to sort through a line graph. There are multiple categories in the Kickstarter that filters are essential to navigate.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If we were to look at other Parental Categories for this module then a stacked line graph would give us a better representaion.
